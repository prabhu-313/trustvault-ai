# TrustVault AI: Privacy-First Federated AI Assistant
> **A privacy-first AI assistant focusing on decentralized NLP tasks and secure data handling.**

## 📌 Overview
TrustVault AI is a privacy-focused language model system developed as part of our final-year B.Tech project. It combines **Federated Learning**, **Differential Privacy**, and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to create a secure AI assistant capable of running locally or in a decentralized environment.

## 🚀 Key Features
- ✅ **Local Training & Inference** using lightweight Transformer models (Phi-2, T5-small, DistilBERT)
- ✅ **Simulated Federated Learning** with encrypted model updates
- ✅ **Differential Privacy** integration via Opacus
- ✅ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline for personalized responses
- ✅ **Streamlit Web UI** for user-friendly interaction

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face Transformers, Streamlit, Opacus
- **Special Features:** FAISS vector store, simulated privacy-preserving techniques

## 🖼️ Sample Outputs
- Text generation, summarization, Q&A outputs with privacy layers
- Screenshots available in `/images`
